Self Collide Prevention : Prevent using the same nick on the same network throughout all client 
connections. Instead have two connections to the same nickname on the same network.
: also changing to a nick that is in a common channel on any given network, that is not the users nickname on a proxy will 
generate a warning that the nickname is already in use elseware and it is not polite to steal nicknames. DO not allow the nick change.
: nick collide bots will not work with this proxy as best as can be avoided. If a personal flood is happening part aall channels change nickname to flod bots nick only 1 char changed, rejoin all channels.

PyNet Converge/Bauderr
===================

PyNet Converge script named [Bauderr](https://wwww.MyProxyIP.com) for [mIRC
](https://www.mirc.com/get.html) and [Adiirc](https://adiirc.com/download.php)
clients. Internet Relay Chat script networked with
[wwww.MyProxyIP.com](https://wwww.MyProxyIP.com/) account and proxy-servers. If
you are using a terminal client you may find it easier to use a web-browser to
interact with the mSL script settings which is actually the proxy-server settings
for that connection. You will have to login with username\@client_name for your
username in your proxy-settings of your IRC client. Sign-in to
<https://wwww.MyProxyIP.com/login.html> to see
your available proxy servers that work with your username and password. Follow
the instructions on <https://wwww.MyProxyIP.com/proxy/> if you use `mIRC` or
`Adiirc` clients. If you are going to open the script more than once; then
copy/paste the `Bauderr` folder to a second new folder name, such as
`Bauderr-copy2` so that you are not running the same script-files more than
once. The only script files which may not be used more than once is the variables 
script file. So instead of creating a second script folder you can just create a second 
variables file and load that in one client, and the original variable file in your 
first client. You will also require a second mirc.ini to save the loaded script files
in; since you have changed the variables file in your mirc.ini file. Just create a shortcut
and specify the new mirc-copy.ini file. Type `/help command line` in mIRC/Adiirc to see
how to do that. Set your background of the far-far background to the image in
`Bauderr\Scripts\bauderr\images\background.jpg`and image-setting to “`normal`” seems
to work best for me.

 

UserName\@Client_Name
--------------------

When you sign-in to a IRC server, with the proxy-server credentials found at
<https://wwww.MyProxyIP.comm/proxy>, then the popup menus will unlock on servers
you are connected to via proxy-server. Your IRC session will resume on the network
if you have connected to it before. Use `/msg *Status ActiveChans` to view all
client-names, networks, and joined rooms you are in, `*Status` will also shows
rooms you have detached. Active network is in bold text. Use `/msg *Status
ClientNames` to view client-names/UserName and networks and nicknames of all
proxy-server connections that use a client name. Set your client-name in your
proxy-server settings as part of your username. `UserName@any_imaginary_client_name` 
(notice the \@ sign) you may put any alphabetic letters and underscores and hyphens 
(not two underscore/hyphen in a row and must contain at-least 3 letters from `a-Z` 
and/or `digits`). There is a maximum 10 letters for client name and 15 letters for 
UserName. Client-name is optional and only useful if you use more than one client or 
use one client more than once. A dcc chat to *Status must be initiated if you connect 
with a client name. This will allow messages destined to each client instead of each 
server connection such as messages relevant to a Network.

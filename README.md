Machine-Gun/Bauderr
===================

Machine-Gun script named [Bauderr](https://www.mslscript.com) for [mIRC
](https://www.mirc.com/get.html)and [Adiirc](https://adiirc.com/download.php)
clients. Internet Relay Chat script networked with
[www.mslscript.com](https://www.mslscript.com/) account and proxy-servers. if
you are using a terminal client you may find it easier to use a web-browser to
interact with the client settings which is actually the proxy-server settings
for that client. You will have to login with username\@client_name for your
username in your proxy-settings of your IRC client. sign-in to
[https://www.mslscript.com/login](https://www.mslscript.com/login.html) to see
your available proxy servers that work with your username and password. Follow
the instructions on <https://www.mslscript.com/proxy> if you use `mIRC` or
`Adiirc` clients. if you are going to open the script more than once; then
copy/paste the `Machine-Gun` folder to a new folder name, such as
`Machine-Gun-copy2` so that you are not running the same script-files more than
once. set your background of the far-far background to the image in
`.\Scripts\bauderr\images\background.jpg`and image-setting to “`normal`” seems
to work best for me.

 

Bauderr\@Client_Name
--------------------

when you sign-in to a IRC server, with the proxy-server credentials found at
<https://www.mslscript.com/proxy>, then the popup menus will unlock on servers
you are connected to via proxy-server. your session will resume on the network
if you have connected to it before. use `/msg *status ActiveChans` to view all
client-names, networks, and joined rooms you are in, `*status` will also shows
rooms you have detached. active network is in bold text. use `/msg *status
ClientNames` to view client-names/UserName and networks and nicknames of all
proxy-server connections. set your client-name in your proxy-server settings as
part of your username. `UserName@any_imaginary_client_name` (notice the \@ sign)
you may put any alphabetic letters and underscores and hyphens (not two in a row
and must contain at-least 3 letters from `a-Z` and/or `digits`). there is a
maximum 18 letters for client name and 15 letters for UserName. Client-name is
optional and only useful if you use more than one client or use one client more
than once.
